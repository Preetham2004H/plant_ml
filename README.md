🌿 Plant Disease Diagnosis System (AI-Powered)🌟 OverviewThis project is an AI-powered system designed to diagnose plant diseases from images. Utilizing a deep learning model (DenseNet201) and an integrated API (Gemini), the system provides instant diagnosis, severity assessment, and dynamic, practical treatment recommendations for non-technical agricultural users.The solution is deployed as a full-stack web application with a lightweight Flask backend and a responsive frontend UI.✨ Key FeaturesAccurate Disease Classification: Achieves >90% accuracy on the test set using a refined DenseNet201 architecture.Intuitive Web Interface: Simple UI for image upload, instant prediction display, and clear results.Dynamic Recommendations (via Gemini API): Integrates the Gemini API to generate real-time, context-aware advice, treatment plans, and additional information, greatly enhancing the user experience beyond a simple classification.Explainable AI (XAI): Uses Grad-CAM visualizations to show why the model made a certain prediction, increasing user trust.Robust Backend: Features logging, error handling, and authentication for secure and reliable API model serving.💻 Tech StackCategoryTechnologyPurposeModelPython, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCVModel training, preprocessing, and prediction logic.ArchitectureDenseNet201 (Transfer Learning)The high-performance deep learning model for classification.BackendFlask, PythonREST API for serving the model predictions and business logic.FrontendHTML5, CSS3 (Responsive Design), JavaScriptUser interface, image upload, and API integration.Deployment(Future: Quantization strategy, Server configuration)Deployment readiness for balancing performance vs. accuracy.AI IntegrationGemini APIGenerative AI for dynamic, user-friendly recommendations/advice.⚙️ Setup and InstallationPrerequisitesPython $3.x$pip (Python package installer)Access to a GPU for training (optional, but recommended)A Gemini API Key (for dynamic recommendations)Local SetupClone the repository:Bashgit clone [Your Repository URL]
cd [Your Repository Name]
Create and activate a virtual environment:Bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
Install dependencies:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Model and Weights:The pre-trained DenseNet201 model weights (.h5 file) are required for the Flask backend to run. Download them and place them in the appropriate directory (e.g., ./backend/model/).Note: If the weights are too large, you may need to provide a link or instructions to download them.Set Environment Variables:Set your Gemini API key in your environment:Bashexport GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
Run the Flask Application:Navigate to the backend directory and run the server:Bashpython app.py
